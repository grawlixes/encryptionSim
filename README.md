# encryptionSim
A password encryption "simulator." Basically a simple exercise in transforming plain text into hashed strings, and then transforming those 
hashed strings back to plain text. I made this to help new programmers (like myself) understand how password encryption works, although I 
don't do too great  job explaining it in my code. You'll need to download both the hashSim.py and the about.txt file to use this
program properly, as the .py file reads from the text document if you choose option "c" to learn more about the program.

I'm really sorry if this is laid out in a confusing way - this website is so strange with how things are uploaded and shared, and
I got confused.

EDIT 04/13/2017 - it's not that confusing. I was just dumb.
