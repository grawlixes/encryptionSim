This is a very simple program I made to simulate a piece of
password encryption software. When a company like Twitter
or Facebook stores usernames and passwords in their
databases, they don't store the passwords in plain text.
If they did that, and a hacker gained access to one of
these databases, it would be catastrophic!

So, instead of storing passwords in plain text, these
companies run their users' passwords through encryption
software, and store these encrypted "hashed strings" in
their databases instead. When a user enters their password,
the submitted password is also put through encryption and
is compared to the hashed string that the website has
stored in the database. If it matches, access is granted.

This is a short explanation, and this program is certianly
not meant to stack up to an actual piece of encryption
software. It's just meant to help you learn something. To
clarify, press 'a' and enter a password in plain text, then
copy the hashed string that the program gives you. Press 'b'
to enter a hashed string, paste the hashed string tht you
copied in, and you should receive the original password that
you typed!

Please let me know of any questions, comments, or concerns
that you have with this program, ESPECIALLY if any of
this information is incorrect or inaccurate! Thank you!

P.S. Due to the simplicity of this program's encryption
algorithm, it is flawed in one way that I'd rather not bother
to explain here, so ask me about it if you're interested.
